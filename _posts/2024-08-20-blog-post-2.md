In this post I talk about why I chose the BTL1 cerification and what I learned.

## What is BTL1?

The Security Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) Certication focuses on the defensive aspects of cyber security hence the name blue team. BTL1 emphasises practical, hands-on skills that are directly applicable to real-world scenarios. From setting up security monitoring tools to conducting incident investigations, the certification prepares professionals to handle the day-to-day challenges of a security operations role.

A major factor in my decision to pursue the BTL1 certification was its emphasis on hands-on experience. Many job advertisements in cyber security require proficiency with tools such as SIEMs and digital forensic tools, and BTL1 provides the practical, real-world experience necessary to meet these requirements. By offering direct engagement with these technologies, the certification allows me to gain the much-needed experience and confidence that I could effectively contribute to a security team.

The exam is 24 hours long and is based on potential real life incident response scenarios.

## Domains Covered and Tools Used

Security Blue Team Covers 6 Domains:

1. Security Fundamentals
2. Phishing Analysis
3. Threat Intelligence
4. Digital Forensics
5. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
6. Incident Response

Tools:

BTL1 covers a wide range of tools here are some notable ones.

- VirusTotal: Malware analysis and IOC (Indicators of Compromise) sharing
- Splunk and ELK Elasticsearch: SIEM and log management
- Wireshark: Network traffic analysis
- Autopsy: Memory forensics
- TheHive5 and MITRE ATT&CK for Incident response
- Snort: Intrusion detection

## What I learned

1. Phishing Artifacts Collection
   I learned to gather and analyse artifacts from phishing emails, including **email headers**, **web links**, and **file attachments**. Using **PowerShell** and **Bash commands**, I created **MD5/sha256 hashes** and analysed them with **VirusTotal** to detect and understand potential threats.

2. Security Monitoring with Splunk  
   I developed proficiency in **Splunk** for comprehensive security monitoring and incident response. I collected, normalised, and analysed logs from various sources, including **firewalls**, **IDS/IPS**, and **endpoint protection systems**. I also created custom dashboards and visualisations to effectively communicate **security metrics** and **incident trends**, and utilised **Splunk's Search Processing Language (SPL)** to investigate security incidents, create queries, and extract actionable insights.

3. Forensic Analysis Tools  
   Hands-on experience with forensic tools like **Autopsy** allowed me to perform in-depth analyses, including **file recovery**, **timeline creation**, and artifact identification on digital storage devices. I used **FTK Imager** to create forensic images of storage devices, ensuring data integrity through hashing.

4. Memory and Disk Analysis  
   I employed **KAPE** for comprehensive memory analysis and investigation of volatile data in live systems. **Scalpel** in Linux was used for carving files from disk images based on file headers and footers to recover deleted data, while **Volatility 3** helped analyse memory dumps from systems to uncover critical information.

5. Threat Intelligence
   I used **MISP** for conducting threat intelligence analysis and research, enhancing my ability to gather and correlate threat data to improve security posture and incident response.

6. Log Triage with DeepBlueCLI
   I also learned to use **DeepBlueCLI** for quickly triaging Windows Event logs to identify signs of malicious activity, streamlining the process of detecting and responding to potential threats.

I definitely believe that having completed the CompTIA Security+ beforehand allowed me to have full focus on the practical elements of the BTL1 course, as the theoretical and fundamental aspects were already well-covered.

## Final Thoughts

The Security Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) certification provided a well-balanced mix of reading materials, videos, and hands-on labs, which contributed to a highly engaging and enjoyable learning experience. The structured approach ensured that theoretical knowledge was effectively complemented by practical application.

What truly stood out for me was the practical exam. It was the first exam Iâ€™ve encountered where the enjoyment came not just from the desire to pass but from genuinely immersing myself in the scenario. The opportunity to apply the skills I had acquired throughout the course to a realistic incident response scenario was both rewarding and confidence inspiring. This practical approach not only reinforced my learning but also enhanced my confidence in handling real-world security challenges. Overall, the BTL1 certification offered a comprehensive and satisfying learning journey, setting a strong foundation for a career in defensive cyber security.
