In this post I talk about why I chose the BTL1 cerification and what I learned.

## What is BTL1?

The Security Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) Certication focuses on the defensive aspects of cyber security hence the name blue team. BTL1 emphasises practical, hands-on skills that are directly applicable to real-world scenarios. From setting up security monitoring tools to conducting incident investigations, the certification prepares professionals to handle the day-to-day challenges of a security operations role.

A major factor in my decision to pursue the BTL1 certification was its emphasis on hands-on experience. Many job advertisements in cyber security require proficiency with tools such as SIEMs and digital forensic tools, and BTL1 provides the practical, real-world experience necessary to meet these requirements. By offering direct engagement with these technologies, the certification allows me to gain the much-needed experience and confidence that I could effectively contribute to a security team.
