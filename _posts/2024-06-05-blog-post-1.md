In this post I talk about why I chose to do the CompTIA Security+, how I went about learning the material for the exam and my overall thoughts.

## Why CompTIA Security+?

When pursing a career in cyber security, it doesn't take you long before stumbling across the CompTIA Security+ certification, which leads me to my first point.

### 1. Industry Recognition

CompTIA Security+ is one of the most well-known and widely recognised certifications in the cyber security field. It's often listed as a baseline requirement for entry-level security jobs and is valued across industries, including government and private sectors. By earning this certification, I knew I’d be positioning myself as a qualified candidate in the eyes of potential employers.

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage of Security Fundamentals

Unlike other certifications that are more specialised, the Security+ exam covers a broad spectrum of foundational security topics. From cryptography to network security, risk management and compliance, the exam covers all the core areas that a security professional should know. For someone like me, who was looking to gain a solid understanding of multiple aspects of cyber security, it was the right fit.

In short, I chose CompTIA Security+ because it offered the perfect combination of industry relevance, practical knowledge, and career advancement opportunities. It was a key stepping stone to establishing myself in cybersecurity while building a foundation for future growth.

## Learning the material

Preparing for the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 exam was a challenging yet rewarding experience. As someone who values a hands-on learning approach, I explored several methods before settling on the one that worked best for me.

I initially explored free resources on YouTube but found many tutors unengaging and lacking structure. Eventually, I turned to Andrew Ramdayal’s Udemy course, "CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 Full Course, Labs, and Study Plan," which proved to be the perfect fit.

Hands-On Labs: One of the main things I loved about this course was the focus on practical labs. Cyber security isn’t just about understanding theory; it’s about knowing how to apply that knowledge in real-world situations. The labs helped reinforce my understanding of key concepts by allowing me to interact with tools and simulate real-world scenarios.

## Revison

Right after completing Andrew Ramdayal's Udemy course, I decided to purchase Professor Messer's practice exams. To gauge my baseline knowledge, I attempted one of the three practice exams without any revision. After finishing the exam, I noted the questions I got wrong and used these to form the foundation of my revision plan.

I created flashcards for the acronyms and topics I struggled with and tested myself consistently throughout the day. After completing all three practice exams, I had built a solid deck of flashcards focusing on areas where I needed improvement. As I reviewed the flashcards and repeated the practice exams, I gradually removed the cards I felt confident with, leaving only the topics that required more attention.

## I Passed!

## Final Thoughts

Despite having completed a cyber security module as part of my Computer Science degree, I quickly realised just how many critical topics were either not covered or only touched upon superficially. The CompTIA Security+ exam allowed me to dive deeper into these areas, providing a more comprehensive understanding of key concepts like threat mitigation, security architecture, and risk management.

The Security+ experience solidified my technical foundation and boosted my confidence, preparing me for advanced certifications.
