title: "Part 2 - Creating a SOC home lab"
excerpt: "In second part of my project, I deployed and configured two virtual machines: a Windows Server and a Linux Syslog Server. The Syslog server will be used to store logs from the FortiGate Next Generation Firewall (NGFW). The Windows Server will eventually be accessible via RDP, with the firewallâ€™s Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) capability detecting and blocking brute force attacks.<br/><img src='/images/project2/thumbnail.png' width=500>"
