A Computer Science graduate with professional experience as an IT Field Engineer and cyber security compliance, passionate in Blue Team security.

## Why cyber security?🌐

The challenge of staying ahead of cyber adversaries and the importance of safeguarding valuable data and infrastructure is exciting and gives me motivation to continue to expand my knowledge. I am drawn to the blue team side of security with a focus on incident response, analysing potential threats and threat intelligence.

My experience in IT infrastructure, system maintenance and user management has helped me develop an appreciation for the critical role robust security measures and policies play in maintaining a solid security posture for an organisation. This motivated me to shift my focus and to follow my passion of cyber defence. I’ve since then earned certifications including CompTIA Security+ and Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) and I’m constantly expanding my knowledge in incident response, threat detection and security operations.

## What you will find here?📍

This site is where I document my journey, share what I learn and explore the latest in cyber security. You’ll find posts on recent cyber news, insights on the certifications I’ve achieved and steps I took to achieve them as well as detailed write-ups of my personal cyber security projects.

Thanks for stopping by.
